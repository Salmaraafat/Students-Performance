##🎓 Student Performance Dashboard | Power BI Project

📊 Overview

The Student Performance Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze student academic performance across multiple dimensions such as gender, lunch type, parental education, and ethnicity.
It visualizes key metrics in math, reading, and writing scores to uncover patterns and support data-driven decision-making in education.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze total and average scores across gender, parental education, lunch type, and ethnicity.

Explore how socioeconomic factors (e.g., lunch type, education level) influence academic achievement.

Provide clear insights through visual storytelling to aid in educational strategy formulation.

Demonstrate Power BI skills in dashboard design, data modeling, and visual analytics.
